# Memorizer

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/petabridge/memorizer)](https://hub.docker.com/r/petabridge/memorizer)

Memorizer is a .NET-based service that allows AI agents to store, retrieve, and search through memories using vector embeddings. It leverages PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension to provide efficient similarity search capabilities.

Key features:
- Store structured memories with vector embeddings
- Retrieve memories by ID
- Semantic search through memories using vector similarity
- Filter search results using tags
- Create relationships between memories to form knowledge graphs
- UI for manually adding, editing, deleting, or viewing memories
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for easy use with AI agents

## Technologies

- .NET 9.0
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- ASP.NET Core
- [Akka.NET](https://getakka.net/) for background jobs, such as re-embedding memories if you change algorithms
- Npgsql for PostgreSQL connectivity

## Installation with Docker

## 🚀 Local Builds

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- .NET 9.0 SDK

### 1. Start Infrastructure and Application

```bash
# From solution root directory
# Build and publish the .NET container

dotnet publish -c Release /t:PublishContainer
```

This creates a container image named `memorizer:latest`.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (port 5432)
- PgAdmin (port 5050)
- Ollama (port 11434)
- Memorizer API (port 5000)

## 🔌 MCP Configuration Example

To use Memorizer with any MCP-compatible client, add the following to your configuration (e.g., `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "memorizer": {
    "url": "http://localhost:5000/sse"
  }
}
```

## 🖥️ Web UI

Memorizer includes a web-based user interface for managing memories through your browser.

### Access the Web UI

Once the application is running (via `docker-compose up -d`), you can access the Web UI at:

**http://localhost:5000/ui/**

### Features

- **Memory Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete memories
- **Search & Filter**: Search memories using semantic similarity and filter by tags
- **Statistics Dashboard**: View memory counts, tag distributions, and system statistics
- **MCP Configuration**: Get the MCP configuration JSON for connecting clients at `/ui/mcp-config`

The Web UI provides a user-friendly interface for all Memorizer functionality, making it easy to manage your AI agent's memory without needing to use the MCP tools directly.

## 🧠 Example System Prompt for LLMs

> You have access to a long-term memory system via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) at the endpoint `memorizer`. Use the following tools:
>
> - `store`: Store a new memory. Parameters: `type`, `content` (JSON), `source`, `tags`, `confidence`, `relatedTo` (optional, memory ID), `relationshipType` (optional).
> - `search`: Search for similar memories. Parameters: `query`, `limit`, `minSimilarity`, `filterTags`.
> - `get`: Retrieve a memory by ID. Parameter: `id`.
> - `getMany`: Retrieve multiple memories by their IDs. Parameter: `ids` (list of IDs).
> - `delete`: Delete a memory by ID. Parameter: `id`.
> - `createRelationship`: Create a relationship between two memories. Parameters: `fromId`, `toId`, `type`.
>
> Use these tools to remember, recall, relate, and manage information as needed to assist the user. You can also manually retrieve or relate memories by their IDs when necessary.
